|  STRENGTH  |  WEAKNESS  | 
|-----------|--------|
 |Resolve all the normal and average type problems very easiely.|certain values which makes the output to be not defined make problem for program and can struct whole program.|
 |Represent in a usser frindely manner.|
---


|OPPURTUNITIES| THREATS|
|---|---|
|this program can make easier for the person to resolve calculation easier and faster.|when some time values enter are or different type it make problem for eexeguting for the program.
|    |person should enter only those values for which he need result.
